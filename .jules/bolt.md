## 2024-05-02 - [Asynchronous Config Pre-loading]
**Learning:** In a heavily asyncio-driven application, seemingly fast synchronous operations like `json.load` for configuration files can create hidden micro-stalls on the main event loop. If lazy-loaded on the first incoming request, this file I/O blocks the entire server from processing concurrent requests until the disk read completes. This is especially impactful in high-concurrency environments like MCP servers.
**Action:** Always proactively pre-load required configurations or heavy resources during server startup events (e.g., `@app.on_event("startup")`) by offloading them to worker threads via `asyncio.to_thread()`. This guarantees immediate cache hits and prevents blocking the event loop when the first burst of user requests arrives.

## 2024-05-05 - [Asynchronous Browser Profile I/O]
**Learning:** File system operations like `shutil.copytree` and `shutil.rmtree` used for copying and deleting Playwright profiles are synchronous and can take significant time. When executed directly on the main event loop in an asyncio-driven application, they create hidden micro-stalls, blocking the server from processing concurrent requests and degrading performance during high concurrency.
**Action:** Always offload blocking file I/O operations, such as profile copying and cleanup, to worker threads using `await asyncio.to_thread()`. This prevents stalling the main event loop and maintains responsiveness.

## 2024-05-12 - [Playwright N+1 Locator Text Extraction]
**Learning:** Using `await items.nth(i).inner_text()` inside a loop after `await items.count()` creates an N+1 query pattern where each text extraction results in a separate network round-trip between the Node.js test runner and the browser. This can cause significant latency if the list is long.
**Action:** Always use `await items.all_inner_texts()` to fetch all texts in a single batch round-trip, then iterate locally over the result to perform the required logic or to find the index needed for a subsequent click via `await items.nth(i).click()`.

## 2024-05-18 - [Unconditional UI Menu Interaction Anti-pattern]
**Learning:** Unconditionally clicking to open dropdown menus or mode pickers in Playwright UI automation without first checking if the desired state is already active causes unnecessary network round-trips, layout thrashing, and waiting. In cases where the desired option (e.g., a specific chat model) is already selected, this adds completely wasted latency to the operation.
**Action:** Always inspect the inner text or state of the menu trigger element first. If it already reflects the desired state, early-return to bypass the expensive click and wait operations. Additionally, always use robust regex matching with lookarounds (e.g., `(?<![\w\-])model_name(?![\w\-])`) when searching for options to avoid false positives with overlapping names like 'GPT-4' and 'GPT-4-turbo'.
